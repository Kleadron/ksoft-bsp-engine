# ksoft-bsp-engine
Kleadron Software BSP Engine written in C#/XNA.

Source code is provided for research purposes. There is no garantee you can run any applications in this repository.

You will need to provide your own assets if they are not included here.

This is my attempt at implementing a unique game engine that processes Quake map files and generates a BSP tree based map structure, eventually with PVS and Lighting.
